Introduction
We learned how to pickle a file. And we learned how to use exception handling. Firstly, using the pickle file is kind of interesting. When you process the file using the pickle syntax it will save the text in some kind of mysterious ASCII format. You can sometimes make out the words if you read the text file but other times you can’t.  It’s like a secret message. To decode the message you process the file again using pickle syntax and the message will be converted to plain text. 
Meat and potatoes
Using the Try and Except is a useful way to handle and exception or error that comes up when your specific command or line of code doesn’t work. When you set up your code within the try block it will run, however if there’s a problem it will be kicked the Except block. Anything after the Except block will get run instead. This is useful for setting up a more descriptive error message. 

Figures
Figure 1 is the snippet of my program running in the system console. In this version of the script I was using the message “Hello from the other side” to test out the pickle function. 
Figure 2 is showing my code in the Spyder IDE. I have added some comments indicating the functions and the while loop.
Figure 3 is the message in the test file. The file was opened with Notepad++. In the file you can see some special encoding characters.
